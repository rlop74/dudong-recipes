        <p>This beef steak is a very easy recipe to make. A tender cut of beef is sliced thin, then marinated with lemon juice and soy sauce for at least an hour.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 pounds New York strip steak, sliced thin</li>
            <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place sliced beef in a large bowl. Whisk together lemon juice, soy sauce, sugar, salt, and pepper in a small bowl; pour over beef and toss to coat. Stir in cornstarch. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour to overnight.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Remove beef slices from marinade, shaking to remove any excess liquid. Discard marinade.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, fry beef slices in hot oil until they start to firm and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer beef slices to a serving platter.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until onion is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes; spoon over beef slices.</li>
        </ol>
